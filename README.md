We used a naming system to make placing/using Shell and Meme objects easier within coding by setting the Shells stats like damage, firerate, range, and health, all by simply attatching each name to a certain set of stats, making a way easier process out of manually setting each Shells stats any other way. Using a 'null' Shell obj for the select, we utilize a click and place mechanic in our game.

Using the click and place system, you first click on the Shell object that is in the ShopUI to create the 'Select' object, that becomes an actual Shell once you click one of the positions on the board, which places the Shell; automatically setting the stats and image of the Shell based on the name system.

We also used a naming system to additionally manage the Memes as well, unfortunately we weren't able to fully develop the Memes and different enemy types
